						<h3>ASP.NET MVC and WebForms</h3>
						<p>
							I have experience working with both ASP.NET MVC and 
							ASP.NET WebForms in C# and vb.net.  I have maintained
							a number of WebForms as well as built a few and I've 
							learned enough MVC to rewrite some of those web forms
							in MVC 3 and 4.

						<h3>Full Stack Development</h3>
						<p>
							With frontend skills in HTML, HTML5, CSS, CSS3, Javascript,
							JQuery and Bootstrap I have a solid grasp of front end development.
							I am comfortable with building logical and business layer objects
							and functions in both C# and vb.net. I am also proficient in writing 
							T-SQL queries and stored procedures and building databases from the 
							ground up.

							2013, 2015 and VS 2017.  I have also worked with SQL Manager and Profiler
							since SQL 7.0 and have worked on various versions since then.  I'm currently
							working with SQL Server 2016.
