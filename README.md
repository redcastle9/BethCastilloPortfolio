Repository for my personal site.

I started with an SPA written in ASP.NET MVC C#.  I used an HTML5 UP (https://html5up.net) template called Miniport so I didn't have to waste a lot of time prettifying it.  I will probably customize it more as time goes on.  For one thing, the designer did not use bootstrap, which I think is easier to customize and for another it doesn't really show off my skills in bootstrap.  Otherwise I'm pretty happy with the way it looks.

I already had to customize the contact form quite a bit.  It was designed to use PHP, but was simple enough to adapt to ASP.NET  I just had trouble figuring out how to use it with a partial view.

I also added a reCaptcha to it as no sooner did I have the form up but I got a spam contact with a link. I thought it would be best to secure it a bit.

I still need to add some javascript to hide the form when I get either a succesful post or an error and display the appropriate message.  I also need to fix up some button links and add items to the portfolio.

When it's all done I'm going to be sad.  I hope someone appreciates it. :)
